## Overview

Allies are NPC characters who fight monsters alongside Shiren.<br/>
There are 4 ally characters in this game - Pekeji, Oryu, Kechi, and Borg Mamel.<br/>
Some characters have a unique ability or can grow stronger through leveling up.

Those looking for a more classic roguelike experience can play without allies.

### Ally HP

Unlike Shiren 5, this game doesn't have a way to display ally HP.<br/>
You can talk to them to get a rough idea, but keep in mind that talking is a turn ending action.<br/>

Medicinal Herb, Restorative Herb, and Herb of Life will restore HP when thrown at an ally.<br/>
Max HP won't increase when they're at full HP.
