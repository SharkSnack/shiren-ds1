# Overview

- Traps are found on the ground and activate when stepped on.
    - They generally apply a negative effect, but some can be utilized to your advantage.
- Traps are normally hidden, and are revealed when you step on them or do a direct attack above them.
    - They become visible if you eat Herb of Sight or have Trap Master status.
    - Springs needed to escape rooms without hallways are always visible.
